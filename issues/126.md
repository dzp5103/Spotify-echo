Set up and integrate validation workflows for MCP servers and initialize report scaffolding.

## Scope
- Add workflows to automate MCP server health checks, discovery, and validation
- Scaffold reporting structure for MCP status, validation, and orchestration
- Ensure workflows trigger on PRs, merges, and scheduled intervals
- Document workflow and reporting setup in project docs

## Subtasks
- [ ] GitHub Actions: Generate CycloneDX SBOM, run `npm audit --json`, run Lighthouse on preview deployments, and upload artifacts to `reports/`
- [ ] MCP validation job: Parse `mcp/registry.yaml`, run per-server health checks (HTTP/CLI), and append results to `reports/mcp-health.md`
- [ ] Scheduling: Nightly cron to refresh `reports/sbom.json` and `reports/perf-baseline.json`
- [ ] Documentation: Update `docs/configuration.md` and create `docs/ci-artifacts.md` describing artifacts and locations
- [ ] PR gating (optional): Warn or fail when MCP health checks fail for required servers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] On PRs to `main`, CI uploads SBOM and health-check artifacts to `reports/`
- [ ] On a nightly schedule, SBOM and perf baseline are regenerated and stored
- [ ] MCP health-check results are visible in `reports/mcp-health.md`
- [ ] Docs updated to explain workflows and artifacts
