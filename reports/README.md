# Reports Directory

This folder holds machine-generated and semi-automated reports created by CI, MCP validations, and the Copilot agent. Do not hand-edit generated files.

Planned artifacts:
- sbom.json (CycloneDX)
- code-graph.md (dependency diagrams)
- redundancy-audit.md (unused files, stale docs)
- mcp-health.md (MCP server health snapshots)
- perf-baseline.json and trend charts
- lighthouse-report.html
- security-scan.md and npm-audit.json
